#PacMen Excercise Repository

Project Description:<br>
This project has two buttons that create a Pacman, and then sets them on random paths at random speeds.  The Pacmen then check page boundaries and bounce off them so that they remain on the screen.  You can add as many Pacmen as you like and even speed them up by clicking the Start Game button again.

How To Run:<br>
Pull all three code files (html, css, and js) and also the Pacman1 image.  Then load the html file on to the browser and they should be able to run.  Click the add Pacman button first, and then the Start Game button.  You can add more Pacmen by clicking the Add Pacmen button once the game has started.

Plans for Improvement:<br>
I would like to utilize the other three Pacman images and make the Pacmen chomp as they move. I would also like to get the Pacmen turn their bodies when they bounce off of the page limits.
